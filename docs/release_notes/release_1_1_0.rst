Release 1.1.0
=============

This release is currently in progress.

New features
------------

The control client, lewis-control, now provides a version argument via ``--version`` or ``-v``. 

::

   $ lewis-control -v 

Bug fixes and other improvements
--------------------------------

 - Lewis now has a logo. It is based on  a state machine with one state that is entered and
   repeated infinitely - like the simulation cycles in Lewis.

   For low-resolution images or settings with little space, there is also a simplified version:

   .. image:: /resources/logo/lewis-logo-simple.png

   The logo was made using `inkscape`_, the font in the logo is `Rubik`_. The two PNGs and
   also the SVGs are in the `source repository`_, feel free to include them in presentations,
   posters.
