Welcome to plankton's documentation!
====================================

Plankton is a Python package that makes it easy to develop complex stateful device simulations. It
is licensed under GPL version 3 and the source is available on github_, where you are welcome to
open new issues so the package can improve.

If you're new to Plankton reading the :ref:`user_guide` is a good start. Once you plan on writing
your own device it's time to go through the :ref:`developer_guide`. The :ref:`api_documentation`
can also help with that.
