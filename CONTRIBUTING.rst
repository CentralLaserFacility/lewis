Contributing to Lewis
=====================

Contributions to Lewis are always welcome and there are different ways of 
contributing to the framework. We aim to respond to all communications within
one working day.


Reporting Issues
----------------

If you run into any issues or bugs while using Lewis, you can help us improve
Lewis by
`opening an Issue <https://github.com/DMSC-Instrument-Data/lewis/issues/new>`__
here on GitHub. Please be sure to include enough information to reproduce the
issue.

If you've already created a fix, you can also directly
`submit a Pull Request <#submitting-pull-request>`__.


Requesting Features
-------------------

If a feature you want is missing from Lewis, feel free to open an Issue here on
GitHub to request it. Please describe the context and the expected behaviour in
detail.

If you've already implemented a new feature and would like to submit it, you
can also directly submit a Pull Request.


Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

We are happy to accept contributed Pull Requests both from Forks and directly
against this repository.

If the Pull Request addresses any open Issues, please reference them with a 
line that reads:

    Closes #123.
    
Or similar, so that GitHub can link the Issue to the PR.

The Pull Request description should detail the purpose of the Pull Request, and
where appropriate should include some instructions on how to test the changes.

Please ensure your Pull Request passes all integration tests and is able to be
merged with master automatically.


Submitting Devices
------------------

If you have a device you would like to contribute to the main repository, we
are happy to accept these as a Pull Request as well. Please see the 
documentation for details on `how to write a device simulator <http://lewis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/writing_devices.html/>`__.
